###### "Please find the PSD referenced in the link below. Again I donâ€™t have specific instructions, so feel free to explore programing techniques  as much as you want. You can go few different roads in terms of interactivity and mobile experience and its all up to you. When done please zip the files back and send it.
---
#### Technologies used:
- HTML5
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- Photoshop
- Inkscape

#### Notes:
- 1 Media Query at 768px
- 3 seperate pages (index.html, build.html & gallery.html) break up the .psd file into a more realistic viewing experience as appose to cramming all content into one page.
- At the bottom of each page, there are button/links to the other pages.
- The appropriate links throughout the site are active (Link to build & price, link to gallery from build & price).

#### Due to time constraint:
- Unable to make button/links with slanted sides.
- Unable to make table and at bottom of gallery page interactive/functional.

Thank you kindly for your time and consideration
